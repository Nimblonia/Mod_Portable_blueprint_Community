#  Portable Blueprints – Community

This GitHub space serves **three purposes at once**:  

1. **Bug reports** – Open an Issue when you find a crash, visual glitch, recipe error, or anything else that’s broken. The template will guide you, and you can attach logs (`latest.log`), screenshots, videos, or even blueprint files (`.bp`) found in  
   `<minecraft-world-folder>/portable_blueprints/blueprints/<your UUID>/<name>.bp`.

2. **Feature requests & design talk** – Use **Discussions** to suggest new mechanics, quality‑of‑life tweaks, balance changes, or just brainstorm fresh ideas. Even if a suggestion doesn’t fit the core vision of the mod, I’ll explain why so everyone understands the direction.

3. **Community chat** – Feel free to treat Discussions as an open lounge: show off builds, share tips, or ask questions. Portable Blueprints exists because of players like you, so don’t be shy.
